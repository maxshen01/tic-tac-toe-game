# Tic‑Tac‑Toe Game

**Created for Hackathon** by **TRIPLE M**  
_A fast‑and‑fun project showcasing teamwork, creativity, and coding under pressure._

##  About the Project

A classic Tic‑Tac‑Toe game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for the browser. Two players can enjoy the familiar 3×3 grid, with the game handling:
- Turn‑based play: players alternate placing **X** and **O**
- Win detection: horizontal, vertical, diagonal
- Draw detection when the board fills without a winner
- A reset button to restart the game

##  Why This Game?

We chose Tic‑Tac‑Toe during the hackathon because:
- It’s **simple and intuitive**—ideal for quick implementation.
- Emphasises **front-end fundamentals**: DOM manipulation, event handling, and UI design.
- Offers opportunities for future enhancements (AI opponent, animations, responsive design).
- Provides a satisfying, complete user experience within the tight hackathon timeframe.
